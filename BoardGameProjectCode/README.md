# Board Game Heatmap Code
## How to use
Run `main.py` and input the details for your sim. If you want it sorted to show you the most common values then copy and paste one of the 2 arrays that are outputted after running `main.py` into the `data` variable in the `listsorter.py` file. Then run it and it will output the data in order of how common they are as well as how many of them there are. If you don't want to spend 10 minutes staring at the output untill it makes sense like I did the first time I used it then know that it outputs like this: `(number, how many there are)`.

## Other things to note
 - The screenshot is a really bad thing I did in google sides to show the actual heatmap on our game board, as you can easily tell by looking at it, I am not good at any form of graphics/visual design especially when working with a powerpoint program
 - The layout.txt file is just some details about the board that I needed to make the main program
 - The heatmapdata.txt is the data I used for the screenshot, it was just copied and pasted from the main program's output
